                <p>
                    “Property” - includes all items placed in storage at Storage Facility. This includes those items listed in the TLV
                    Storage Proposal as well as any items which Renter subsequently places in storage, as will be agreed in
                    additional Attachments or documents. The items will be considered Property so long as items remain at the

                </p>
                <p>
                    Renter owns Property and requires a facility or location to temporarily store the said Property.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Storage Facility” or “Facility” – 480 and/or 510 Barnum Ave, Bridgeport, CT or any additional property leased or

                </p>
                <p>
                    During the term of this Agreement, Storer hereby agrees to store the said Property at the Facility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Storage Period” - Storage shall commence on the day the Property arrives at the Storage Facility and shall
                    continue on a month to month basis until Renter takes back the Property or the Property is sold through the
                    Storer per the Renter’s Consignment Agreement with The Local Vault.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Storage Fee” or “Fee” - Renter will be charged each month, on or after the first of the month, the Storage Fee
                    for that calendar month. This Fee will be the sum of the individual Storage Fees, as outlined in the TLV Storage
                    Proposal, for all items that are at the Facility as of the 1 st of the month. The first month’s Storage Fee for an
                    item shall be from the date of arrival of the Property at the Facility and will be prorated for the number of days
                    left in the month. Storer may charge to Renter’s credit card, or other payment methods provided by Renter, the
                    Fee on due date of such. There are no options for partial monthly payments or refunds after the first month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Storage Fee Increase & Decrease - The monthly Fee is subject to increase or decrease based on the items added
                    to or removed from Property. If Renter wishes to remove any Property then Storer must be notified at
                    logistics@thelocalvault.com to arrange for pickup of this Property from the Storage Facility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inspection - Storer and Renter are each responsible for inspection of goods when they arrive at the Facility.
                    Storer is not responsible for damage caused by moving, delivery or packing materials not provided by Storer.

                    Renter thirty (30) days written notice of its intention to do so. In the event the Renter fails to remove any stored
                    Property within the thirty (30) day period the Storer reserves the right to have the Property removed from the
                    Storage Facility and disposed of at the expense of the Renter. In such an event the Storer shall be relieved of any
                    liability with respect to the Property therefore or thereafter. The Renter has the right to terminate the
                    Agreement at any time and once all Property is removed from Facility then Storage Fees will no longer be
                    charged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Non-Payment of Storage Fees - In the event the Renter does not pay any unpaid balance of Storage Fees the
                    Storer, after giving the Renter thirty (30) days written notice, can treat the Property as abandoned. Storer may
                    sell such abandoned Property in a commercially reasonable manner and apply the proceeds from such sale
                    towards any unpaid Storage Fees as well as to any costs incurred in the sale. Storer will forward any remaining
                    balance of the proceeds to Renter. Storer also has the right to donate or dispose of the Property as it is deemed
                    abandoned. In all such events the Storer shall be relieved of any liability with respect to the Property therefore
                    or thereafter. Any expense Storer incurs to donate or dispose of the Property will be for the account of Renter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ownership of the Property - Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted as conveying
                    title to, or any interest in, the Property to the Storer other than in the event of Non-Payment of Storage Fees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Warranties - The Renter represents and warrants that he/she/it is the legal owner of the Property, or an agent
                    thereof, and has the legal right and authority to contract for services for all of the Property. Renter agrees to
                    indemnify and hold harmless the Storer from and against any and all claims relating to breach of this warranty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Renter’s Property Insurance Requirement - Renter agrees to maintain adequate insurance coverage for
                    Property. The Storer agrees to exercise reasonable care to protect the Property from theft or damage and shall
                    maintain adequate insurance to protect the Renter from any loss or damage caused by the Storer's gross
                    negligence or willful misconduct. Storer shall not be liable for any loss or damage to Item(s) tendered, stored or
                    handled, however caused, unless such loss or damage resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
                    of Storer. Storer provides no primary coverage against loss or damage to Property, unless such loss or damage is
                    caused by Storer’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Renter agrees to maintain adequate insurance
                    coverage.
