                <p>
                    Hereinafter the personal Property placed in consignment through this Consignment Agreement will be described as
                    “Item(s)”. Item(s) will be listed for sale on TLV’s website for an “Initial Term” of 6-months. Please review all sections of
                    this Agreement for full listing details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consignor grants unto TLV the authority to advertise, offer for sale and sell the Item(s) listed in the TLV “Pricing
                    Proposal” which you will receive after the Item(s) is photographed, measured and evaluated. Consignor has the right to
                    withdraw any Item(s) from the consignment within 48 hours after the Pricing Proposal is sent. The Pricing Proposal will
                    include the sale price at which TLV believes the Item(s) should be listed for sale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consignor represents and warrants that the Item(s) included in the “Pricing Proposal”, and any additional Item(s) which
                    the Consignor chooses to consign and/or store with TLV, is generally described personal Property that Consignor is the
                    legal owner of, or an agent thereof, and Consignor has the legal right and authority to contract for services for all of the
                    Property. Consignor agrees to indemnify and hold TLV harmless from and against any and all claims relating to breach of
                    this warranty.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the Pricing Proposal, when <b> "Dropoff by Consignor Required" </b> is checked and the Item is not in TLV storage facility,
                    the Consignor agrees to drop it off at The Local Vault's office in Cos Cob, CT, within two weeks from the date the Item
                    was purchased by the "Buyer." Should the Consignor not drop off the Item within these two weeks, TLV will arrange for
                    the Item to be picked up, and the Consignor will be charged a $75 fee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For larger Item(s) that are not in storage with TLV Consignor will allow pick-up to take place at the location designated

                        such costs is not conditional on the sale of the Item(s). Consignor confirms that all LIGHTING that is consigned
                        is operational unless otherwise noted to TLV agent.

                        For Item not in storage, should Item condition change after Photoshoot Consignor will notify TLV of such
                        change so listing can be adjusted and, if the Item has sold, change can be discussed with buyer prior to TLV
                        arranging pickup of the Item. If TLV is not notified of condition change and the item is sold then, at the
                        discretion of TLV, Consignor will be responsible for shipping charges to deliver and return the Item or will
                        accept either a reduction in sale price equal to the cost to repair the Item or any reduction in sale price agreed
                        between TLV and the Buyer to Complete the sale.
                        For Item in storage with TLV, Consignor will be responsible for any change in Item condition between when
                        consignment was accepted by TLV and delivery to TLV Storage Facility. In such situation Consignor, at TLV’s
                        discretion, will be responsible for the cost of repair or will accept a reduction of TLV Price as determined by
                        TLV.

                        Unless, after the Photoshoot, it is determined that an Item is not suitable for listing, the Item(s) will be advertised
                        and offered for sale on the TLV website at the Advertised Price (defined below). Consignor acknowledges that

                        “Advertised Price” is the price at which each Item(s) is offered for sale on the TLV website. For the initial 3
                        months of the sale, the “Advertised Price” of the Item(s) will be the “TLV Price” as set forth in the Pricing
                        Proposal unless a different price is mutually agreed prior to commencement of the sale. Should an Item not sell
                        during this initial 3-month period, the Advertised Price for the Item(s) will automatically be reduced by 30%.

                    <li>
                        The Advertised Price listed for each Item excludes applicable sales tax, which TLV will add to the Buyer's

                        TLV uses Sales Events, including early access for Trade members, Trade Discounts, and Coupons to help drive
                        sales of Items. These Discounts and Coupons offered to prospective buyers range from 10-15%. For a sold
                        Item(s) any reduction from the Advertised Price will be shared between TLV and the Consignor.

                        Item(s) made available for sale through TLV include the “Make-an-Offer” functionality. Make-an-Offer allows
                        prospective buyers to “Offer” to buy an Item at a price below the Advertised Price. If such an Offer is made the
                        Consignor will then have the ability to “accept”, “reject” or “counter” the Offer. Please note that Discounts will
                        not be applied when Buyer is utilizing the Make an Offer feature.

                        When Buyer takes possession of the Item(s) the sale is considered “Completed”. When the sale of an Item(s) is
                        Completed TLV shall retain a commission as a percentage of the “Sale Price” for its services. The Sale Price is
                        the price paid by the Buyer for the Item(s) less any transaction fees. The “Net Sale Proceeds” to be received by
                        the Consignor is calculated as the Sale Price less TLV commission. The Net Sale Proceeds will be sent to the
                        Consignor at the address provided within approximately 14 business days after the sale is Completed.

                    <li>
                        After sale of an Item is agreed with a Buyer(s), unless Consignor is obligated to drop off Item at The Local
                        Vault’s office or the item is in storage with TLV, TLV will schedule with Consignor a date and time for a pickup of sold Item. After the Item’s sale pick-up is expected to occur within 2 weeks for delivery to a local buyer
                        and within 6 weeks if delivery to the buyer will be by a national shipper. Consignor will cooperate and
                        coordinate with TLV to ensure that sold Item is Easily Accessible for pick-up. “Easily Accessible” is defined as
                        located on the first floor of a multi-story dwelling including the garage. All Items must be prepared for pick up
                        (i.e. removal of all personal belongings from the Item(s) sold and beds must be disassembled). If Items are not
                        Easily Accessible and prepared for pickup, Consignor may incur costs related to picking up the Items.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Buyer is responsible for delivery or shipping costs of the Item. Buyer may refuse any Item at pickup or at the
                        time of delivery should the Item not meet Buyer’s expectation. If Buyer chooses to not accept an Item even
                        though it is in the condition that was represented on the TLV website, then Buyer shall be responsible for any
                        costs related to the return of the Item. If TLV has misrepresented the Item then TLV will bear the return costs.
                        Once Buyer takes possession of Item the Item is no longer eligible for return and the sale is considered
                        “Completed”.

                    <li>
                        TLV shall not be liable for any loss or damage to Item(s) tendered, stored or handled, however caused, unless
                        such loss or damage resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of TLV. TLV provides no primary
                        coverage against loss or damage to Consignor’s Item(s), however caused. Consignor agrees to maintain adequate
                        insurance coverage.

                    <li>

                        Item(s) free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, and there are no reserved or hidden security
                        interests in any Item(s) that is the subject of this Agreement.

                    <li>
                        Consignor shall indemnify and defend TLV from and against any losses, damages, liabilities, and expenses,
                        including reasonable attorney’s fees, arising from or relating to any claim alleging any loss or damage to persons
                        or property, related to any transaction or interaction with TLV and its agents.

                    <li>
                        Consignor acknowledges and accepts these Storage Terms & Conditions
                        <br/><br/>

                        “Storage Facility” or “Facility” – 480 and/or 510 Barnum Ave, Bridgeport, CT or any additional property leased
                        or owned by TLV for the purpose of storage.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Stored Item(s) - At the Storage Facility TLV only plans to accept delivery of Items for which TLV has agreed to
                        accept consignment of and provide storage. Delivery of any other Item(s) may be refused by TLV, and the
                        delivery provider must return the Item(s) to the Consignor. In the event an Item(s) is delivered to the Storage
                        Facility for which TLV did not agree to provide storage, that Item(s) becomes the property of TLV and Consignor
                        agrees to compensate TLV for any costs related to the disposal of such Item(s) should such costs be incurred.
                        Such costs will be either charged to Consignor’s credit card or deducted from Net Sale Proceeds.

                        <br/><br/>
                        “Storage Period” - Storage shall commence on the day the Property arrives at the Storage Facility and shall
                        continue until Consignor takes back the Property or the Property is otherwise removed from Storage Facility, due
                        to sale or otherwise, as provided for in Agreement.
                        <br/><br/>

                        Ownership of the Property - Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted as conveying
                        title to, or any interest in, the Property to the TLV.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Consignor’s Property Insurance Requirement - Consignor agrees to maintain adequate insurance coverage for
                        Property. TLV shall not be liable for any loss or damage to Item(s) tendered, stored or handled, however caused,
                        unless such loss or damage resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of TLV. TLV provides no
                        primary coverage against loss or damage to Property, unless such loss or damage is caused by TLV’s gross
                        negligence or willful misconduct.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Warranty Disclaimer - TLV PROVIDES THE FACILITY AND THE SERVICES "AS IS" WITHOUT
                        WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY
